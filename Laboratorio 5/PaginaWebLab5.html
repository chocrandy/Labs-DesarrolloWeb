                <h3>¿What do Systems Engineers do?</h3> <br>
                <p> Systems engineers play an integral role in the success of businesses in many industries.
                    They lay the foundation or blueprint for systems to begin conception, production, and realization of
                    valuable operations. The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) dates the origin of
                    systems engineering back to World War II (1940s) at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Today, systems
                    engineering is a process that includes identifying a problem based on consumer needs and developing
                    a
                    solution that is constantly re-evaluated throughout its execution. In short, systems engineers
                    monitor
                    the performance of systems and continually assess all stages of operations to ensure that a problem
                    is
                    solved.</p>

                <h3>Systems Engineer Job Overview</h3> <br>
                <p>Generally, systems engineers are responsible for the development and maintenance of efficient systems
                    and
                    processes. The ultimate goal of a systems engineer is to eliminate inefficiencies in a specific
                    process
                    for
                    the benefit of everyone involved, from those participating in the system to the eventual
                    stakeholders
                    who
                    will reap the benefits. The following lists the scope of responsibilities in systems engineering:
                </p>
                <ul> * Systems Operation</ul>
                <ul> * Systems performance</ul>
                <ul> * Testing, analysis, and retesing</ul>
                <ul> * Manufacturing</ul>
