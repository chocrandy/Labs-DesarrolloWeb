            <h3>¿What do Systems Engineers do?</h3>
            <p> Systems engineers play an integral role in the success of businesses in many industries.
                They lay the foundation or blueprint for systems to begin conception, production, and realization of
                valuable operations. The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) dates the origin of
                systems engineering back to World War II (1940s) at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Today, systems
                engineering is a process that includes identifying a problem based on consumer needs and developing a
                solution that is constantly re-evaluated throughout its execution. In short, systems engineers monitor
                the performance of systems and continually assess all stages of operations to ensure that a problem is
                solved.</p>

        <h4>Systems Engineer Job Overview</h4>
        <p>Generally, systems engineers are responsible for the development and maintenance of efficient systems and
            processes. The ultimate goal of a systems engineer is to eliminate inefficiencies in a specific process for
            the benefit of everyone involved, from those participating in the system to the eventual stakeholders who
            will reap the benefits. The following lists the scope of responsibilities in systems engineering:</p>
        <ul>Systems Operation</ul>
        <ul>Systems performance</ul>
        <ul>Testing, analysis, and retesing</ul>
        <ul>Manufacturing</ul>
